# Enigma
This is just an replica of enigma machine which was used in world war II.It doesn't have all the features of it but it runs like it.

**[NOTE]**
As I said it doesn't have features that features are changing the rotor position,adding new rotors,adding options to choose any three rotors from 4-5 rotors, plugbox etc.
